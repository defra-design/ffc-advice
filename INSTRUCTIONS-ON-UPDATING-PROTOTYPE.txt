SPRINT VERSION CONTROL

Follow these steps to keep the prototype up-to-date

Contents
1. Duplicate Version directory
2. Updating index page
3. updating find adviser filtering prototype
4. updating find funding prototype


1. DUPLICATE VERSION DIRECTORY
Simply select the current directory (example v1-4) and save it as
a new chronological version.

2. UPDATE INDEX PAGE
When you begin a new sprint you should update /views/index page
so that the work for each sprint is correctly represented. To 
archive the current sprint, scroll down the page until you find
the 'Previous phases' comment above the accordion component code.

Then copy the code block that has the comment <!-- SPRINT ... -->
above it. Include this comment too.

Within this, you will see the following comment:

<!-- CONTENT --><!-- END CONTENT -->

Now scroll back up to the current sprint, copy the code that appears
between the same 'CONTENT / END CONTENT' comments, and replace the
code in the accordion block.

You can then change the relevant URLs to correspond with the new
version directory created in step 1 above.

3. UPDATING FIND ADVISER FILTERING PROTOTYPE

3.1. Duplicate routes_v1-4.js and mirror the naming convention of the 
updated directory completed in the above step (example routes_v1-5.js).

3.2. Inside this new file, update the following line accordingly 
var folder = "v1-4/_find-adviser/filters"

3.3. Open routes.js and add a line to corrolate to this new js file you
created in step 1. The new line should look like this:

router.use('/v1-5', require('./routes_v1-5'))

NB: Make sure you use correct syntax and close the previous line with
a comma, example:

router.use('/v1-4', require('./routes_v1-4')),
router.use('/v1-5', require('./routes_v1-5'))

UPDATING FIND FUNDING PROTOTYPE

After creating the new routes.js version file, find the following line of
comment:
// ROUTING for funding eligibility journey

all insances of the folder name e.g /v1-4/ needs to be updated to align
with the new folder version
