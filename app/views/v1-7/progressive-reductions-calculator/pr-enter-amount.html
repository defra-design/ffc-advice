              <p class="govuk-body">To get a more accurate result for 2024 if you have not claimed BPS each year or your land has changed, you can either:</p>
              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>use the average claim value you received between 2020-2022 as your starting payment amount</li>
                <li>calculate what proportion of the the 2024 payment you’re likely to receive</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="govuk-body">You should divide the 2024 payment:</p>

                <li>by 3 if you claimed for 1 out of the 3 years</li>
